# The Cloudless Module Directory

This repository is the backend for the Cloudless Module Directory.  This is a
static listing of the known modules for Cloudless.  Anything in here will show
up on https://getcloudless.com/modules/ after regenerating the site using the
scripts that pull down this data file.  This should be the source of truth for
the latest modules.

To add a new module, just create a pull request on `modules.yml`!  See the
comments in that file for how to structure your entry.
